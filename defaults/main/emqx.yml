# EMQX Configuration
# Secret cookie is a random string that should be the same on all nodes
# in the given EMQX cluster, but unique per EMQX cluster.
# It is used to prevent EMQX nodes that belong to different clusters
# from accidentally connecting to each other.
# This should be a random string, unique per cluster
# Default value is not secure - please change in production
emqx_node_cookie: "emqxsecretcookie"

# Static discovery settings
# When using static discovery, Ansible will automatically collect all deployed nodes in the cluster
# No need to manually configure static_nodes list
# This is the simplest discovery method and works well for fixed cluster configurations
emqx_cluster_discovery_strategy: static

# Manual discovery settings
# When using manual discovery, Ansible will automatically make
# all other nodes join the emqx_initial_host node
# This is useful when you want to explicitly control
# which node other nodes should join
# emqx_cluster_discovery_strategy: manual
# emqx_initial_hostname: s1.emqx.dev  # The hostname that other nodes will join

# etcd discovery settings
# When using etcd discovery, EMQX nodes will register themselves in
# etcd and discover other nodes
# This is useful for dynamic cluster configurations where nodes may come and go

# emqx_cluster_discovery_strategy: etcd

# Expiration time of the etcd key associated with the node.
