# EMQX cluster settings
emqx_cluster_name: emqx_cluster

# Static discovery settings
# When using static discovery, Ansible will automatically collect all deployed nodes in the cluster
# No need to manually configure static_nodes list
# This is the simplest discovery method and works well for fixed cluster configurations
emqx_discovery_strategy: static

# Manual discovery settings
# When using manual discovery, Ansible will automatically make all other nodes join the emqx_initial_host node
# This is useful when you want to explicitly control which node other nodes should join
# emqx_discovery_strategy: manual
# emqx_initial_hostname: s1.emqx.dev  # The hostname that other nodes will join

# etcd discovery settings
# When using etcd discovery, EMQX nodes will register themselves in etcd and discover other nodes
# This is useful for dynamic cluster configurations where nodes may come and go
# emqx_discovery_strategy: etcd

# List of etcd servers to connect to
emqx_etcd_servers:
  - http://etcd-server-1:2379
  - http://etcd-server-2:2379

# Prefix used for EMQX keys stored in etcd
# All EMQX cluster data will be stored under this prefix

# Time-to-live for node registration in etcd
# Nodes must refresh their registration within this time period
# or they will be considered offline

# EMQX cluster ports
# These ports are used for inter-node communication in the EMQX cluster
# List of required ports:
#   - 4370: Used for EMQX distributed Erlang port mapping and inter-node RPC calls
#   - 5370: Used for EMQX distributed node discovery and cluster formation
